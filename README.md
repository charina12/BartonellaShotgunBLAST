# BartonellaShotgunBLAST

Analysis of Bartonella contigs from shotgun sequencing of three flea samples (D62, D70, D71).

BLAST databases were created utilizing publically available _Bartonella_ genomes for detection of _Bartonella_ contigs. Further analysis focuses on visualization of alignment and selection of sequences that to not align with the reference genome. 

Alignments were also made to select reference genes.
